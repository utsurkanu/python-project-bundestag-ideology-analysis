## Overview
This project examines how political ideology is expressed in speeches from the German Bundestag. Using computational text analysis and large language models, it explores whether party speeches reflect recognizable ideological positions and how similar or different parties are in ideological terms.

The project treats ideology as **multidimensional**, rather than placing parties on a single left–right scale.
